# aws_appsync_auth_link_dart - DEAD PROJECT

An AWS AppSync Auth Link  for Dart.

## Project intention

This is meant to fill the gap for https://github.com/zino-app/graphql-flutter/ that https://github.com/awslabs/aws-mobile-appsync-sdk-js solves for https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client.

That is, AWS JS SDK provides an auth link to use Cognito pools with Apollo Client. GraphQL Flutter is supposed to provide similar functionality to ApolloGraphQL, but AWS does not have an SDK publishing an auth link for dart.

## State of the project. 

Turns out this isn't needed. See https://github.com/zino-app/graphql-flutter/issues/209#issuecomment-598835690
